# Progress Documentation Skill

Generate comprehensive progress documentation files with tiered detail levels for work sessions, implementations, and project milestones.

## Usage

```bash
/progress-documentation                    # Document current session to ~/user_docs
/progress-documentation "Feature X"        # Document specific work
/progress-documentation --output ./docs    # Custom output directory (override)
```

## Default Output Location

All progress documentation is saved to **`~/user_docs/`** - a centralized, device-wide location that persists across projects.

```bash
~/user_docs/
├── trophy-testing-infrastructure-setup_2026-02-03_1115.md
├── auth-system-implementation_2026-02-03_1430.md
└── database-migration-postgres-to-mysql_2026-02-03_0900.md
```

**Why centralized?**
- Documentation persists even if project directories are deleted
- Easy to search across all work sessions
- Single location for all progress reports
- Works across different projects and codebases

## Document Structure

The generated documentation follows a **tiered detail** approach:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY             │  ← High Level (30 seconds)
│   Key outcomes, status, usage       │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│       MEDIUM-LEVEL DETAIL           │  ← Medium Level (5 minutes)
│   What was built, components,       │
│   files changed, methods used       │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│       LOW-LEVEL DETAIL              │  ← Low Level (deep dive)
│   Architecture, code examples,      │
│   configs, troubleshooting          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Output Format

\`\`\`bash
# How to verify the work
{verification command}
\`\`\`

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| {Problem} | {Fix} |

## References

- **Repo/Location**: {path}
- **Documentation**: {path}
- **Related Work**: {links}

## Next Steps

1. {Action item 1}
2. {Action item 2}
3. {Action item 3}

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Gather Session Context

Collect information about the work performed:
- What was the goal?
- What components were created/modified?
- What was the outcome?
- What commands/tools were used?

### Step 2: Determine Output Location

**Default: Use centralized `~/user_docs/`**

```bash
# Ensure centralized directory exists
mkdir -p ~/user_docs

# Verify location
ls -la ~/user_docs/
```

**Override with `--output` flag for project-specific docs if needed:**

```bash
/progress-documentation --output ./docs/progress
```

### Step 3: Generate Timestamp

```bash
date "+%Y-%m-%d_%H%M"
# Output: 2026-02-03_1115
```

### Step 4: Write Document

Structure content in three tiers:

1. **Executive Summary** (High Level)
   - Status table with key outcomes
   - Immediate usage commands
   - 30-second overview

2. **Medium-Level Detail**
   - What was built (prose description)
   - Component tables
   - File change lists
   - Installation method

3. **Low-Level Detail**
   - Full architecture diagrams
   - Code examples with syntax highlighting
   - Complete configuration files
   - Troubleshooting tables
   - Verification commands

### Step 5: Verify and Confirm

```bash
# Check file was created
ls -la {output_path}

# Show line count
wc -l {output_path}
```

## Best Practices

### Content Guidelines

| Level | Audience | Time to Read | Content Focus |
|-------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Executive | Managers, stakeholders | 30 seconds | Outcomes, status, quick start |
| Medium | Team members, onboarding | 5 minutes | What, why, how (overview) |
| Low | Implementers, maintainers | 15+ minutes | Full technical detail |

### Writing Tips

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Lead with outcomes, not process
   - Use tables for scannable status
   - Include copy-paste commands

2. **Medium Detail**
   - Explain the "what" and "why"
   - List all files touched
   - Show installation/setup steps

3. **Low Detail**
   - Include full code snippets
   - Document all configuration
   - Add troubleshooting for known issues
   - Include verification steps

### File Organization

**Centralized Location (Default):**

```
~/user_docs/                              # Device-wide progress docs
├── trophy-testing-infrastructure-setup_2026-02-03_1115.md
├── auth-system-implementation_2026-02-03_1430.md
├── database-migration_2026-02-02_0900.md
└── feature-x-implementation_2026-02-01_1400.md
```

**Project-Specific (Optional Override):**

```
project/docs/
├── progress/                    # Project progress documentation
├── architecture/                # System design docs
└── guides/                      # How-to guides
```

## Example: Infrastructure Setup Documentation

This skill was created from documenting the Trophy Testing Infrastructure setup:

**Session Goal:** Install MCP tree-sitter server and everything-claude-code plugin

**Document Created:** `trophy-testing-infrastructure-setup_2026-02-03_1115.md`

**Structure:**
- Executive Summary: Plugin status, MCP server status, usage commands
- Medium Detail: Components built, files created/modified/deleted, installation method
- Low Detail: Full architecture, parser dataclasses, workflow phases, language-specific examples, troubleshooting table

## Integration with Other Skills

- **`/codemap-template`** - Generate CODEMAP.md for architecture documentation
- **`/trophy-workflow`** - Document trophy testing implementations
- **`/checkpoint`** - Save verification state for later reference
